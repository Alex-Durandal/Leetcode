ou are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

Example 2:


```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

只要不相邻即可，那么我们只要考虑前两位的状态
```
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if(nums==null||nums.length==0)
            return 0;
        int f1 = 0,f2=0,f3=0;    //f1为k-1时的最大值，f2为k-2的最大值,f3为当前最大值
        for(int n:nums){
            f3 = Math.max(f2+n,f1); //当前最大值为k-1时的值，和k-2加当前值的最大值
            f2 = f1;
            f1 = f3;
        }
        return f3;
    }
}
```
