Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

Example:

```
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
    Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

Note:

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

```
class Solution {
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        int last_jump_max = 0;
        int cur_jump_max = 0;
        int step = 0;
        for(int curPos = 0; curPos<nums.length-1; curPos++){
            cur_jump_max = Math.max(cur_jump_max,curPos+nums[curPos]);  //当前所有遍历过的位置可达的最远距离
            if(curPos==last_jump_max){  //当前位置为上一阶段所能达到的最远位置时，跳下一跳
                step++;
                last_jump_max = cur_jump_max;
            }
        }
        return step;
    }
}
```
