Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1


```
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Example 2

Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```


Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

高斯公式解法：
```
class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int sum = 0;
        int l = nums.length;
        for(int n : nums)
            sum+=n;
        return l*(l+1)/2 - sum;  // 0~n个数的和为n(n+1)/2,减去当前数组的和即为缺失的数
    }
}
```
